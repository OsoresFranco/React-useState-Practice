# :seedling: React useState Practice :seedling:

First practices after taking React courses on **Scrimba, CodigoFacilito** and **Udemy**.

This app is able to take inputs from users and save it into State, after data is submitted, it is saved on LocalStorage and rendered on its own component.

It's pretty basic on its usage, but it led me to practice data transfer between components in React.
